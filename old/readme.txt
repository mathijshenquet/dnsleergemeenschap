The only thing you'll need to do to use this example is CHANGE THE CSENUMBER to the one that Google provide you.  I have not provided one, but I have got the variable in place.

So go to line 22 in the googleCustomSearch.php file and replace the text there with the alpha-numeric ID that Google provide you with.  

Upload it to your server, make a form that posts a single string to search.php (remember to change line 8 on search.inc.php to reflect your naming convention).  You should be good to go.
